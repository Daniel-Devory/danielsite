                    In the iRobot Fall 2023 Hungry Hungry Hippo Intern Challenge, we were tasked 
                    with a unique goal: to design a robot that could collect and deliver as many 
                    balls as possible in record time. Our mighty team of three got to work researching, 
                    designing, and testing, ultimately building a robot that claimed first place. 
                    <br> <br>
                    As the Electrical & Computer Engineer on the team, I focused on the Arduino and  
                    its interfacing components, including the iRobot Create 3 Platform, HC-06 Bluetooth 
                    Module, servo motor, and spinner drivetrain. This project was not only technical, 
                    but also a creative adventure. I'm incredible proud of our innovative designs, 
                    hands-on prototyping, and the sheer fun we had bringing our ideas to life.

                    We figured there had to be plenty of machines out there for picking up all kinds of 
                    balls - tennis balls, golf balls, volleyballs? Sure enough, we were right! We stumbled 
                    upon a YouTube video titled "4 life-changing tennis ball retrievers" and it was truly 
                    life-changing. With a dash of inspiration from some of the designs we encountered 
                    during our research, we ended up with the masterpiece that is the whiteboard drawing 
                    below.

                    With a rough mechanical design in place, I was ready to map out what we'd need 
                    electrically. From the sketch, I knew we'd need need at least two motors: one to spin 
                    the ball-collecting spinner, and another to open the back door. We also needed a 
                    reliable way to power and control these motors. Next is a dive into the electrical 
                    design, but I'll wrap up the mechanical side by saying that the fundamentals stayed 
                    pretty consistent throughout this project. So you will also find a mockup of the final 
                    mechanical design below!

                    So, how did we reliably power and control the motors? Check out the system overview below, 
                    and we'll dive into each component. At the heart of our motor control system was the trusty 
                    Arduino Uno. Connected to it was an L298N motor driver, driving two DG01D motors. While 
                    these DC motors have a recommended voltage of 4.5V, we pushed them through some in-house 
                    testing and found they ran reliably at 14V üòÅ - a huge plus since one of our power sources 
                    as the Create 3 robot's 12V, 2000 mAh battery. 
                    <br><br>
                    At full power, controlled by the L298N via PWM, the spinner spun way faster than needed, so 
                    we were reassured the motors could handle what we would actually throw at them. We didn't 
                    necessarily need two spinner motors, but why not have two for redundancy and more power, 
                    especially since we only needed about 20 minutes of runtime for the competition. The Create 
                    3 also had a handy USB-C port supplying 5V, which we used to power the Arduino and SG90 servo 
                    motor. Since the Arduino was on the Create, we needed a way to send commands wirelessly, and 
                    the HC-06 Bluetooth module fit the bill.
