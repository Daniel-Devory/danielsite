                    Maine's sugar kelp production faces challenges such as location restrictions 
                    and limited monitoring capabilities. Our client WaveWise approached Generate, 
                    Northeastern's product development club, to create a prototype capable of 
                    dynamic depth adjustment for optimal kelp growth. Our team of 11 talented 
                    individuals delved into researching, ideating, designing, and testing a system 
                    that incorporated a winch system with stepper motor powered depth control.
                    <br> <br>
                    As an Electrical & Computer Engineer on the team, my primary focus was on 
                    power systems, software architecture, and the design and bringup of the Buoy 
                    PCBA. I collaborated closely with the five other EECEs and our mechanical 
                    engineering counterparts, contributing to the incredible product we were able 
                    to showcase at the end. It was a fulfilling experience working on WaveWise, 
                    navigating the challenges, and contributing to a multifaceted project that 
                    blended innovation with sustainability.

                    When initially tasked with overseeing the power system, I used an existing system—the 
                    crab pot puller—as a baseline for power draw requirements. I operated under this 
                    power assumption while our mechanical engineering team calculated our specific motor 
                    wattage needs. Below are some of the major considerations I took into account when 
                    designing and selecting components for the system:
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Temperature</li>
                    <li>Continuous/Peak Discharge</li>
                    <li>Capacity</li>
                    <li>Weight</li>
                    <li>Lifetime Expectancy (cycle count, ratings)</li>
                    <li>Environment</li>
                </ul>

                <p> 
                    <br>
                    Most of the crab pot pullers I found were in the range of 3/4 to 4 hp, equating to 
                    approximately 500 to 3000 W. At the initially planned 12V for our design, this meant a 
                    current draw of 125 A for a 2hp equivalent system. I then made the decision to run our 
                    system at 48V. With these considerations in mind, I opted for LifePo4 batteries due to 
                    their high power density, lower cost compared to Li-ion, and favorable temperature, 
                    cycle count, and discharge characteristics.

                    After receiving updated power value calculations from the mechanical team, significant 
                    changes were made to the power design. With motor power requirements adjusted to 180W, 
                    a 288W motor was selected for its holding torque of 8.5nM, providing a Factor of Safety 
                    (FOS) of approximately 1.5x at 48V. The stepper motor was chosen for its 'locking' 
                    capabilities and measurable movement based on steps. At 48V, the stepper motor would 
                    draw a max continuous 6A, much more reasonable than the current we were looking at 
                    originally. We also chose a Pololu motor controller that offered feedback data, 
                    including a stall line, and the flexibility to adjust micro-stepping for future torque, 
                    energy, and vibration optimization.
                    <br><br>
                    I chose a 48V, 10AH LiFePO4 battery pack with a built-in 20A BMS that would provide ample 
                    power for peak draw requirements, supporting over an hour and a half of continuous use. 
                    Realistically, the motor would not be running at full power continuously, and rather only 
                    have this hour and a half of use over 2-3 days at the worst. Complementing the battery, 
                    four 12V solar panels in series, each rated for a maximum of approximately 4 Amps, were 
                    introduced to recharge the battery ensuring that it never discharge. This solar setup could 
                    almost fully sustain full motor power and charge the battery from 0-80% in two hours. To 
                    streamline the charging process and address time constraints, a dedicated charge controller 
                    was acquired instead of designing a custom switching circuit. The controller chosen ensures 
                    the battery is charged at the required 55V, accommodating the solar panels' peak supply of 
                    74.4V under optimal conditions. At this point, the high voltage power architecture was 
                    complete, and the purchases had been made.

                    In the realm of software architecture for the WaveWise project, the focus was on 
                    efficient and responsive handling of sensor data and movement control. I mean just 
                    take a look at that awesome flowchart I made below! The software design was divided 
                    into three main segments: Overall, Sensor Readings, and Movement.

                    <br><br>
                    Overall:<br>
                    This incorporates cycles of sleep mode to conserve battery, lasting 10 minutes each, 
                    and periodic checks of the sensors to assess the necessity of movement before 
                    transitioning back to a low-power state.

                    <br><br>
                    Sensor Readings:<br>
                    In this phase, the system enters a full-power mode where all sensors—measuring pH, 
                    salinity, temperature, UV light, depth/pressure, and nitrate—are activated and polled. 
                    The information gathered from the sensors is read through either the I2C or SPI lines. 
                    The sensor reading process also involves the storage of data in JSON format on an SD 
                    card for further data analysis as per the clients request. This phase was a crucial 
                    bridge between data collection and subsequent decision-making.

                    <br><br>
                    Well, the client requested nitrate data, but its sensor would have single-handedly 
                    eaten up our entire budget.

                    <br><br>
                    Movement:<br>
                    When deemed necessary based on sensor readings, the system transitions into the 
                    movement mode. This phase orchestrates the required movements until sensor readings 
                    reach satisfactory levels. An important condition for movement is the 
                    verification of a sufficiently high battery voltage ~(>15%) charge to guarantee 
                    uninterrupted system functionality.
