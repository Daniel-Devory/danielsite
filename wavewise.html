                    Maine's sugar kelp production faces challenges such as location restrictions 
                    and limited monitoring capabilities. Our client WaveWise approached Generate, 
                    Northeastern's product development club, to create a prototype capable of 
                    dynamic depth adjustment for optimal kelp growth. Our team of 11 talented 
                    individuals delved into researching, ideating, designing, and testing a system 
                    that incorporated a winch system with stepper-motor-powered depth control.
                    <br> <br>
                    As an Electrical & Computer Engineer on the team, my primary focus was on 
                    power systems, software architecture, and the design and bringup of the Buoy 
                    PCBA. I collaborated closely with the five other EECEs and our mechanical 
                    engineering counterparts, contributing to the incredible product we were able 
                    to showcase at the end. It was a fulfilling experience working on WaveWise, 
                    navigating the challenges, and contributing to a multifaceted project that 
                    blended innovation with sustainability.

                    When initially tasked with overseeing the power system, I used an existing system—the 
                    crab pot puller—as a baseline for power draw requirements. I operated under this 
                    power assumption while our mechanical engineering team calculated our specific motor 
                    wattage needs. Below are some of the major considerations I took into account when 
                    designing and selecting components for the system:
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Temperature</li>
                    <li>Continuous/Peak Discharge</li>
                    <li>Capacity</li>
                    <li>Weight</li>
                    <li>Lifetime Expectancy (cycle count, ratings)</li>
                    <li>Environment</li>
                </ul>

                <p> 
                    <br>
                    Most of the crab pot pullers I found were in the range of 3/4 to 4 hp, equating to 
                    approximately 500 to 3000 W. At the initially planned 12V for our design, this meant a 
                    current draw of 125 A for a 2hp equivalent system. I then made the decision to run our 
                    system at 48V. With these considerations in mind, I opted for LifePo4 batteries due to 
                    their high power density, lower cost compared to Li-ion, and favorable temperature, 
                    cycle count, and discharge characteristics.
